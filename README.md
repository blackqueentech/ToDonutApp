Base functionality:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] All tasks persist [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Adds support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Additional task details are added, such as due date and notes
* [ ] Expand upon a task by tapping an item in the list to see more information about it
* [ ] Ability to mark tasks as completed, and see that reflected in the UI
* [ ] Feast their eyes on a bright, fun, and organized UI

Notes
-----

Many of my challenges came from using a DialogFragment instead of an Activity to affect views in the app. Once I figured out how to
make listeners out of the activities I was referencing, those were fixed. This app is the first time I've ever worked with the action bar built
into Android so learning how to manipulate that was pretty nice. And I have never worked with material design as seriously as I did while
building this project, so I'm glad for that. I know I have much more to learn though!

Thanks

To Frank for his guidance and support. :)
